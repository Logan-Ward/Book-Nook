# Book Nook
An app that allows users to share their favorite or newly discovered reading spots. 
Users can upload photos, descriptions, and directions along with GPS data to assist 
fellow users in finding the right spot for themselves. The reading locations will 
have different tags associated with them to further narrow down the right spot for 
a particular reader, such as indoor/outdoor, busy/quiet environment, seating 
available, etc. Subsequent users of a spot can review it. Maybe allow booking of a 
site to prevent usage overlap. Have some tags that will assist groups like book
clubs to find a spot.
